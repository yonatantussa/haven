## 🌟 Inspiration

Haven was inspired by the growing number of natural disasters and the urgent need for fast, organized, and efficient support systems. With Hurricane Helene and countless other recent disasters affecting millions of lives, we recognized the need for a platform that empowers individuals and organizations to quickly provide relief. Watching communities struggle to connect evacuees with resources like shelter and essential supplies pushed us to create a tool that simplifies and accelerates this process. Our goal is to turn compassion into action by building a stronger network of support when it's needed most.

## 📦 What It Does

Haven allows nonprofits and individuals in need to:

Request goods and supplies.
Find temporary shelters quickly and easily.

## 💻 How We Built It

Languages: Python, JavaScript</br>
Frameworks/Libraries: Flask, React, Next.js</br>
Database: SQLite</br>
Other Tools: Git, Docker, etc.</br>

## 🏗️ How to Run Locally

To run Haven locally, follow these steps:

Backend (Flask)
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask server:
python app.py
Frontend (Next.js)

Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd frontend

Install the required dependencies:
npm install

Run the Next.js development server:
npm run dev

You should now be able to access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## 🛠️ Challenges We Ran Into

User Interface: Creating an interface that was simple yet powerful enough to handle both shelter and donation needs.</br>
User Privacy: Ensuring user privacy while displaying relevant information, especially with home locations.

## 📚 What We Learned

The importance of user feedback in the design process.
Technical skills in React, Flask, and database management.
Effective project management and teamwork strategies.

## 🔮 What's Next for Haven

Implementing additional features such as:
Enhanced verification and security of user information.
A rating system for shelters and hosts.
